# Malware-Dev
Contains my Code, Notes, and Resources for Malware Development

<p>This repo will be a collection of various projects; some my own, others are from classes. The structure will change alot as I add more code.</p>
<p>If your Anti-Virus blocks this repo or doesn't allow you to download the full thing, I must be doing something right.</p>
<p>If a Script doesn't work, you're missing a library, or running it on the wrong system. Any Script I make, I test on the Target OS first.</p>
<p>Lastly, please don't use this for anything illegal.</p>
